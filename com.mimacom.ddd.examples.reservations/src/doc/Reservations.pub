	Section «Situation»
	P «A party of **n** people enter a restaurant at which they would like to eat but don't have a table reservation.»
	
		Subsection «Business Domain» 
		P «The business domain this scenario is **restaurant management**.»
		
		Subsection «Party»
		P «One of the two central entities in this scenario is the party of people, short party. In this context, party is a virtual concept referring to a number of people who have a common purpose like travelling or a some social gathering. A party exists only as long as there are members sharing a purpose. There is no physical evidence of the party as such.»

		Subsection «Table»
		P «The other central entity in this scenario is the table. Tables are physical objects that have a life in the physical world. Since this domain model is not about manufacturing a table, it only captures the existence and the properties of a table but it is not concerne with, for example, creating a table. The tables of a restaurant simply exist, however, the domain model is concerned with their presence, their size, and maybe their locations, e.g. at the window, on the terrace, by the bar, etc.»

		Subsection «Party enters Restaurant»
		P «A Part enters a restaurant and steps up to the signpost reading "Wait to be seated".»
